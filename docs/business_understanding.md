# Business Understanding

## The Business Objectives

The first objective of the analyst is to thoroughly understand, from a business perspective, what the customer really wants to accomplish. Often the customer has many competing objectives and constraints that must be properly balanced. The analyst’s goal is to uncover important factors at the beginning of the project that can influence the final outcome. A likely consequence of neglecting this step would be to expend a great deal of effort producing the correct answers to the wrong questions.

### Background

The Background section provides a basic overview of the project context. This lists what area the project is working in, what problems have been identified, and why data mining appears to provide a solution.

#### Organization

- [ ] Identify key persons in the business and their role
- [ ] Identify the business units which are affected by the data mining project (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Finance

#### Problem Area

- [ ] Identify the problem area (e.g., marketing, customer care, business development, etc.)
- [ ] Describe the problem in general terms
- [ ] Clarify prerequisites of the project (e.g., What is the motivation of the project? Does the business already use data mining?)

### Business objectives

The Business Objectives section describes the goals of the project in business terms. For each objective, Business Success Criteria, i.e., explicit measures for determining whether or not the project succeeded in its objectives, should be provided. This section should also list objectives that were considered but rejected. The rationale of the selection of objectives should be given.

- [ ] Informally describe the problem to be solved
- [ ] Specify all business questions as precisely as possible
- [ ] Specify any other business requirements (e.g., the business does not want to lose any customers)
- [ ] Specify expected benefits in business terms

### Business success criteria

- [ ] Specify business success criteria (e.g., Improve response rate in a mailing campaign by 10 percent and sign-up rate by 20 percent)
- [ ] Identify who assesses the success criteria

## Assessing the current situation

This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources, constraints, assumptions, and other factors that should be considered in determining the data analysis goal and in developing the project plan

### Inventory of resources

List the resources available to the project, including personnel (business and data experts, technical support, data mining experts), data (fixed extracts, access to live warehoused or operational data), computing resources (hardware platforms), and software (data mining tools, other relevant software).

The Inventory of Resources section aims to identify personnel, data sources, technical facilities, and other resources that may be useful in carrying out the project.

#### Sources of data and knowledge

- [ ] Identify data sources
- [ ] Identify type of data sources (online sources, experts, written documentation, etc.)
- [ ] Identify knowledge sources
- [ ] Identify type of knowledge sources (online sources, experts, written documentation, etc.)
- [ ] Check available tools and techniques
- [ ] Describe the relevant background knowledge (informally or formally)

### Requirements, assumptions and constraints

List all requirements of the project, including schedule of completion, comprehensibility, and quality of results and security, as well as legal issues. As part of this output, make sure that you are allowed to use
the data.

List the assumptions made by the project. These may be assumptions about the data, which can be verified during data mining, but may also include non-verifiable assumptions related to the project. It is particularly important to list the latter if they will affect the validity of the results.

List the constraints made on the project. These constraints might involve lack of resources to carry out some of the tasks in the project in the time required, or there may be legal or ethical constraints on the use of the data or the solution needed to carry out the data mining task.

This section lists general requirements for the project’s execution: type of project results, assumptions made about the nature of the problem and the data being used, and constraints imposed on the project.

#### Requirements

- [ ] Specify target group profile  
- [ ] Capture all requirements on scheduling  
- [ ] Capture requirements on comprehensibility, accuracy, deploy ability, maintainability, and repeatability of the data mining project and the resulting model(s)  
- [ ] Capture requirements on security, legal restrictions, privacy, reporting, and project schedule

#### Assumptions

- [ ] Clarify all assumptions (including implicit ones) and make them explicit (e.g., to address the business question, a minimum number of customers with age above 50 is necessary)  
- [ ] List assumptions on data quality (e.g., accuracy, availability)  
- [ ] List assumptions on external factors (e.g., economic issues, competitive products, technical advances)  
- [ ] Clarify assumptions that lead to any of the estimates (e.g., the price of a specific tool is assumed to be lower than $1,000)  
- [ ] List all assumptions regarding whether it is necessary to understand and describe or explain the model (e.g., how should the model and results be presented to senior management/sponsor)

#### Constraints

- [ ] Check general constraints (e.g., legal issues, budget, timescales, and resources)
- [ ] Check access rights to data sources (e.g., access restrictions, password required)  
- [ ] Check technical accessibility of data (operating systems, data management system, file or database format)  
- [ ] Check whether relevant knowledge is accessible  
- [ ] Check budget constraints (fixed costs, implementation costs, etc.

## Output of the project

A business goal states objectives in business terminology; a data mining goal states project objectives in technical terms. For example, the business goal might be, “Increase catalog sales to existing customers,”  
while a data mining goal might be, “Predict how many widgets a customer will buy, given their purchases over the past three years, relevant demographic information, and the price of the item.”


The Data Mining Goals section states the results of the project that enable the achievement of the business objectives. As well as listing the probable data mining approaches, the success criteria for the results in data mining terms, should also be listed.

### Data Mining Goals

Describe the intended outputs of the project that enable the achievement of the business objectives. Note that these are normally technical outputs.

- [ ] Translate the business questions to data mining goals (e.g., a marketing campaign requires segmentation of customers in order to decide whom to approach in this campaign; the level/size of the segments should be specified).  
- [ ] Specify data mining problem type (e.g., classification, description, prediction, and clustering). For more details about data mining problem types, see Appendix 2.

### Success criteria

Define the criteria for a successful outcome to the project in technical terms, for example a certain level of predictive accuracy or a propensity-to-purchase profile with a given degree of “lift.” As with business success criteria, it may be necessary to describe these in subjective terms, in which case the person or persons making the subjective judgment should be identified.

- [ ] Specify criteria for model assessment (e.g., model accuracy, performance and complexity)  
- [ ] Define benchmarks for evaluation criteria  
- [ ] Specify criteria which address subjective assessment criteria (e.g., model explain ability and data and marketing insight provided by the model

## Project Plan

List the stages to be executed in the project, together with their duration, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Wherever possible, make explicit the large-scale iterations in the data mining process— for example, repetitions of the modeling and evaluation phases. As part of the project plan, it is also important to analyze dependencies between time schedule and risks. Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations for actions if the risks are manifested. Although this is the only task in which the project plan is directly named, it nevertheless should be consulted continually and reviewed throughout the project. The project plan should be consulted at minimum whenever a new task is started or a further iteration of a task or activity is begun.

This section lists the stages to be executed in the project, together with their duration, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Where possible, it should make explicit the large-scale iterations in the data mining process—for example, repetitions of the modeling and evaluation phases.

- [ ] Define the initial process plan and discuss the feasibility with all involved personnel  
- [ ] Combine all identified goals and selected techniques in a coherent procedure that solves the business questions and meets the business success criteria  
- [ ] Estimate the effort and resources needed to achieve and deploy the solution. (It is useful to consider other people’s experience when estimating timescales for data mining projects. For example, it is often postulated that 50-70 percent of the time and effort in a data mining project is used in the Data Preparation Phase and 20-30 percent in the Data Understanding Phase, while only 10-20 percent is spent in each of the Modeling, Evaluation, and Business Understanding Phases and 5-10 percent in the Deployment Phase.)  
- [ ] Identify critical steps  
- [ ] Mark decision points  
- [ ] Mark review points  
- [ ] Identify major iterations

### Tools and techniques

At the end of the first phase, the project team performs an initial assessment of tools and techniques. Here, it is important to select a data mining tool that supports various methods for different stages of the process, since the selection of tools and techniques may influence the entire project.

This section gives an initial view of what tools and techniques are likely to be used and how. It describes the requirements for
tools and techniques, lists available tools and techniques, and matches them to requirements.

- [ ] Create a list of selection criteria for tools and techniques (or use an existing one if available)  
- [ ] Choose potential tools and techniques  
- [ ] Evaluate appropriateness of techniques  
- [ ] Review and prioritize applicable techniques according to the evaluation of alternative solutions
